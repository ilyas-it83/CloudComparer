This is the second version of my Cloud Comparison Slide deck which i prepared a year back(can be downloaded here: http://www.slideshare.net/ilyas_it83/microsoft-azure-vs-amazon-web-services-aws-services-feature-mapping). The version 1 recieved more than 22K views and 400+ download at the time of working on this project. This gave me the idea of creating a robust and dependable comparison/mapping between the various services offered by the major cloud providers in a lively and updatable format.

The project is open sourced to let fellow Cloud Architects,IT Pros,Developers to feel free to edit and update the comparison upto date.
